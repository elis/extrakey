ExtraKey - Make your mobile device act as a secondary keyboard

I know it lacks a lot of information, but I just wanted to get it out of the door as soon as it's technically working so other people can start experimenting with it.

# What is it?

ExtraKey is a NodeJS application that in combination with NirCMD (on windows, no other platform support just yet) can provide you with a simple interface that you can customize to fit your needs to create a secondary (or more than one) input device using your existing mobile devices (tablets, smartphones).

Currently it can send any imaginable key combination directly from your device to your computer where the application is being deployed, allowing you to make keyboard shortcuts easily accessible and visually prominent.

The project was inspired by the [Shortcut-S Keyboard](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/5074048/special-dedicated-editing-keyboard-for-photoshop) currently raising funds on Kickstarter (full disclosure: I've pledged my support for that project).

The project and code file are provided AS IS under the MIT license.
